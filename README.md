# story-api
This is an API that will allow to create / play an interactive fiction game. If you are unfamiliar with the interactive fiction genre, the games are played through a story that are only interactive through reading and writing. The stories will include features such as a playable character that has armor and miscellaneous items, other characters that will help or harm you, and random story events. I will create a story as a demo, but users will be able to create their own stories by creating new story elements, or mixing and matching story elements that have already been written.
